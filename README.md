<h2>About the task</h2>
<p>The interviewers required the creation of a full stack application within a 3 day deadline using FastAPI & React with the further requirement of fetching data from https://pokeapi.co/. MongoDB was used for storing user information and the project was deployed with herokuapp. All styling was done using styled-components whilst animations were created using framer-motion.</p>
